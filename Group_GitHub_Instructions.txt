The following instructions are for each member in group 8 to follow when starting to work on your designated code.
Follow these steps everytime you want to work on anything.

!Important : PLZ Shoutout what you are working on when you start work so that we don't accidentally work on the
same file and overwrite one another's work.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Start Here: 

Make an empty folder called "Group_Project"
//!you will only do this once

Open terminal, follow steps => cd Group_Project
//open up this folder in your terminal...this should be empty..and is where you will be cloning the project to for you to start 
//working on your code 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

git clone "https://github.com/Group-Art-Project/Art-Project.git" 
//this is to manually grab the updated code from the main branch so you have the newest version

git checkout -b branchName 
//after "-b" type in what you want your branchName to be... name your branch in camelCase based off whatever youre working on

--------
//Work on project now, whatever needs to get done, do it at this step...
//review work and make sure it is working/running properly before you move on to next steps
//save code/changes
--------

git add .
//this will add the changes you made to your code. Will add to your branch "branchName"

git commit -m "message"
//here your "message" will contain whatever you worked on...for example... -m "Updated axios calls" or -m "added new schema in model"

git push origin branchName
//this will push your branch, branchName (the name that you came up with during git checkout), into our teams GitHub repository

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

at this point: 
1. make the pull request
2. ping the team to have changes reviewed for the push into the main branch.
3. someone will review merge/pull request
4. now your branchName is pushed into the main branch
5. check the updated project repo to see if your new code is in there
6. you can delete your local project inside your Group_Project folder...
7. when ready to work on new code again, repeat steps from the top 

attached are screenshots of what pull request looks like on GitHub >>>>>
